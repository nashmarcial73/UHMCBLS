          <p>"I've been lucky enough to call Maui home for a little over 
            five years and currently serve as the Manager of Administrative 
            Operations at Trilogy Excursions. <br><br> When I'm not making sure our 
            crews and behind the scenes operations are running smoothly, 
            you can find me outdoors soaking up the sunshine or on a motorcycle 
            exploring Maui's back roads. My other half and I are also gearing 
            up for our next big adventure, starting our own business."</p>

            entrepreneur and start my own company in the future. 
            <br><br>I love learning about finance and marketing, and I enjoy 
            working with people who share creative ideas. In my free time, I like 
            going to the gym and exploring new hobbies."</p>

          <p>"I'm majoring in ABIT and focusing on the technology side of it. I currently work as a porter
            for Hawaiian Airlines. My goal is to find a job in IT, then focus on my hobbies: going to
            the gym, playing the piano, and cooking food. I plan to move to the mainland once I graduate
            because I prefer the vibe there for now, but I will for sure miss Maui."</p>
